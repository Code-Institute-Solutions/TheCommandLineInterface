# The Command-Line Interface

This is our first look at the command-line interface. The command-line interface is the lowest level interface that we have with a computer, and can accomplish all of the things that we would normal do with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), and much more!

## Technologies Used

In this project we used the terminal to execute some commands to move around the file system and create, modify and delete files and folders.
